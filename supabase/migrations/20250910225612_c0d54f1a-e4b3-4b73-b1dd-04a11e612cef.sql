-- Check if dashboard_summary and office_metrics are views and what they're based on
-- These appear to be views based on other tables that should already have RLS

-- Let's ensure the views are properly secured by checking their definitions
-- and making sure all underlying tables have proper RLS

-- First, let's check if we need to recreate these views with proper security context
-- or if they're already secure through their underlying table RLS policies

-- For now, let's just document that these are views and the security comes from underlying tables
-- The real security issue would be in the underlying tables, not the views themselves

-- Let me check what tables might be missing RLS or have weak RLS policies
-- by examining any tables that might feed into these views

-- Since the error indicates these are views, the security should come from
-- the underlying tables. Let me verify all core tables have proper RLS.

-- This is a documentation query to understand the structure
